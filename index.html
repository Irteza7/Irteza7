<h1>Irteza's Python & Data Engineering Portfolio</h1>

<p>Hello! I'm Irteza, a passionate data enthusiast with hands-on experience in Data Engineering, Analytics, and Machine Learning. Through my projects, I've explored various facets of the data ecosystem, from real-time data processing to cloud-based analytics. I'm driven by the thrill of transforming raw data into meaningful insights.</p>

<h2>ðŸš€ Projects</h2>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/Irteza7/Azure_databricks">Azure Databricks - Formula 1 Analysis</a></h3>
<p>Dived deep into Formula 1 data using Azure Databricks, focusing on performance metrics of drivers and teams. This project combined cloud-based data engineering with in-depth data analysis.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/Irteza7/Fast_api">Fast API</a></h3>
<p>An exploration of FastAPI, a modern, fast web framework for building Python-based APIs. This project not only showcases my proficiency in Python development but also my expertise in deployment and CI/CD. I utilized Render for seamless deployment of the application, integrated GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment, and containerized the entire application using Docker for scalability and easy replication.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/Irteza7/Data_eng_project">Weather Data Engineering Project</a></h3>
<p>Built an end-to-end data pipeline for real-time weather data. Integrated Kafka for data streaming, orchestrated the pipeline with Apache Airflow, and stored processed data in a PostgreSQL database. The entire project is containerized using Docker.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/Irteza7/Data_Eng">Data Engineering Playground</a></h3>
<p>A collection of exercises and projects from the IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate. Explored real-time data processing, Spark-based data analysis, and ETL automation using Apache Airflow.</p>

<h2>ðŸŒ± Learning & Growth</h2>
<p>I believe in continuous learning and am always on the lookout for opportunities to expand my knowledge. If you have a challenging problem or an interesting project, I'd love to collaborate!</p>
